# Data Streaming and Analytics in smart city

Our project aims to provide an architecture to stream and analyse the data collected at smart homes. We can demonstrate some distributed ideas of distributed co-ordination, distributed data analytics. The aim here is to provide a robust infrastructure to build a smart community.

***Architecture Requirements***
```
The architecture should solve these problems.
(a)Location transparency. That is the servers can be anywhere.
(b)Data protection. Data should be encrypted while being moved to the server.
(c)Reliability â€“ any part of the system can break down.
(d)Online Query: Look into the support of CEP/ online Query.
(e)Plug and play. The architecture should be modular. That is, any new component can be plugged in.

We have to think about adding distributed techniques into our architecture.
